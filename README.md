## 📝 Project Overview

### 🔹 Small Classification Projects
- **Pizza or Steak Classifier:**  
  Binary image classification to predict whether a given image is pizza or steak.

- **IMDB Movie Review Classifier:**  
  Sentiment analysis on IMDB movie reviews to classify them as positive or negative.

---

### 🔸 Multi-Class Classification Projects (📁 `multi_class_projects`)
- **Food-101:**  
  Classify food images into one of **101 classes**. A challenging, real-world dataset.

- **MNIST:**  
  Classic handwritten digit classification task (0-9).

- **Fashion MNIST:**  
  Image classification to predict fashion items like shoes, shirts, and bags across **10 classes**.
